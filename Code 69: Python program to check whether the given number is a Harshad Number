 If a number is divisible by the sum of its digits, then it will be known as a Harshad Number.
# Ex - 156
# Sum of digits = 12
# 156 is divisible by 12.
# So 156 is a harshad number

number = 155

def sum_of_digits(num):
    sum = 0
    for each in str(num):
        sum += int(each)
    return sum

if number % sum_of_digits(number) == 0:
    print("Harshad Number")
else:
    print("Not a harshad number")
