Difference between find() and index() with Example.
Both are almost the same, slightly have a difference.
If the substring not found - 
- find() will return -1
- index() will raise an Error

Code -
org_string = "This is Mayank Gupta"
print(org_string.find("Code")) # Outputs -1 -  We are searching for 'Code'.
print(org_string.index("Code")) # Raised a Value Error.
